# FightBase landing — progress

_Last updated: 2026-10-25_

## Done
- 2026-10-25 — All 7 signup buttons point to https://app.fightbaseapp.com/signup (ET/RU/EN).
  Merged to main (7f23c13), live and verified on www.fightbaseapp.com.
- 2026-10-25 — Signup buttons pass the page language (`/signup?lang=et|ru|en`); the app reads
  `?lang=` (fightbaseapp c1e1a1c). Merged to main (8f6bccf), live and verified.
- 2026-10-25 — `TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md` signup URL updated from bilt.me to
  app.fightbaseapp.com/signup. Old branches `fix/signup-links`, `fix/signup-lang` and
  `chore/claude-setup` deleted.
- 2026-10-25 — Branch `club-tool-page`: home page rewritten for the club tool (not a
  marketplace). Hero = app welcome-screen wording + "Loo oma klubi" → app `/?lang=`;
  header "Logi sisse" → app `/signin?lang=`; "Kuidas see töötab" in 3 steps, sports line,
  second button. Removed camps, pricing, problem/features sections, founder quote and the old
  camps screenshot. RU now uses вы. Tested at 375px. **Not merged yet — waiting for Jen.**

## Next
- Rewrite Terms and Privacy for the coach tool: coaches enter members' personal data, so
  FightBase acts as their data processor (GDPR). Before the first real club.
- Step 3: event QR code + A5 print PDF in `/event` (after the page is merged).
- Optional: a real "Täna" phone screenshot below the fold. Needs a test account with invented
  names; skipped because it needs a login to the live app.
- Answer the native-speaker questions in `TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md` (ET and RU).

## Waiting on Jen
- Check the `club-tool-page` preview on your phone, then say "merge it".
- Decide whether the old local branch `hero-redesign` is still needed. If not, delete it.
- Native ET/RU check of the wording.
